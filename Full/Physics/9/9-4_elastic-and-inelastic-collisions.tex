\subsection{Elastic and Inelastic Collisions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{elastic collision} is one where there is no loss of kinetic energy.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \textbf{very low speed impact} between two cars is almost perfectly elastic provided no damage is done.
        \end{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{inelastic collision} occurs where the colliding objects have less kinetic energy after the collision than before the collision.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Objects that collide and \textbf{couple together} undergo inelastic collision.
            \item Some of the initial kinetic energy is \textbf{transferred to the surroundings}.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To work out whether a collision is elastic or inelastic, the kinetic energy of each object before and after the collision must be calculated.
