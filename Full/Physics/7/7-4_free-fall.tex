\subsection{Free Fall}

\subsubsection*{Acceleration Due to Gravity}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a \textbf{vertical metre rule} to provide a scale.
    \item Take a \textbf{video clip} of a ball's flight after being \underline{released from rest}.
    \item Use the video to measure the \textbf{time of descent} of the ball and the \textbf{distance fallen} by the ball from rest.
    \item Since $s=ut+\dfrac{1}{2}at^2$ and $u=0$, we have $s=\dfrac{1}{2}at^2$.
    \item Plot a graph of $s$ against $t^2$.
    \item The acceleration due to gravity is $2\times\text{gradient}$.
\end{enumerate}

Since there are \underline{no external forces} acting on the object apart from the force of gravity, this value of acceleration is known as \textbf{the acceleration of free fall} and is represented by the symbol $g$.
$$g\approx9.8\text{ms}^{-2}$$
