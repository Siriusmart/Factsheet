\subsection{Acceleration}

Acceleration is defined as change of velocity per unit time, the unit of acceleration is metre per second per second $\text{ms}^{-2}$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acceleration is a vector.
    \item \textbf{Deceleration values} are negative and signify that velocity \textbf{decreases with respect to time}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Uniform Acceleration}

Uniform acceleration is where the velocity of an object \textbf{moving along a straight line changes at a constant rate} such that the acceleration is constant.

For an object that \textbf{accelerates uniformly} from velocity $u$ to velocity $v$ in time $t$ along a straight line.
\begin{align*}
    a&=\frac{v-u}{t}\\
    v&=u+at
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Non-uniform Acceleration}

Non-uniform acceleration is where the direction of motion of an object changes, or its speed changes, at a \textbf{varying rate}.

It can be seen from a \textbf{velocity-time graph} because the gradient is not constant.

$$\text{Acceleration}=\text{gradient of the line on the velocity-time graph}$$
