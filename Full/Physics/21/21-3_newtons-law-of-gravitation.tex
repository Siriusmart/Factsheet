\subsection{Newton's Law of Gravitation}

\textbf{Kepler's third law} states that the value of $\dfrac{r^3}{T^2}$ is the same for all planets.

\textbf{Newton's law of gravitation} states that the gravitational force between any two \textbf{point objects} is
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always an \textbf{attractive} force.
    \item Proportional to the mass of each object.
    \item Proportional to $\dfrac{1}{r^2}$, where $r$ is their distance apart.
\end{itemize}

The last two requirements can be summarised as
$$F_g=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
Where $G$ is the \textbf{universal constant of gravitation}.
$$G=\frac{Fr^2}{m_1m_2}$$
The value of $G$ is $6.67\times10^{-11}\text{N\,m}^2\,\text{kg}^{-2}$
