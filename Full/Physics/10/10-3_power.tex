\subsection{Power}

Energy can be transferred from one object to another by means of
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Work done} by a force due to one object making another object move.
    \item \text{Heat transfer} from a hot object to a cold object.
    \item Electricity, sound waves and electromagnetic radiation also transfer energy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Power} is defined as the rate of transfer of energy, the unit of power is the \textbf{watt}, equal to an energy transfer rate of 1 joule per second.

If energy $\Delta E$ is transferred steadily in time $\Delta t$
$$P=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$

Because energy transferred is equal to the work done by the force, the rate of transfer of energy is equal to the work done per second.

\subsubsection*{Engine Power}

The \textbf{motive power} is the output power of an engine.

When a powered object moves at a \textbf{constant velocity} at a constant height, the \textbf{resistive forces} are equal to the \textbf{motive force} - the work done by the engine is transferred into the internal energy of the surroundings by the resistive forces.
$$P=Fv$$

When a powered object gains speed, the output force exceeds the resistive forces on it.
\begin{align*}
    \text{Motive power}=&\ \text{energy per second wasted due to resistive forces}\\
                        &+\text{gain of kinetic energy per second}
\end{align*}
