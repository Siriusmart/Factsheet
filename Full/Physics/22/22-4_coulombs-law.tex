\subsection{Coulomb's Law}

The forces between two charged objects depends on how close they are to each other.

Coulomb's law states the force between two \textbf{point charges} distance $r$ apart
$$F=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r^2}$$

The constant of proportionality $k=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}=9.0\times10^9$mF$^{-1}$.

Coulomb's law is therefore written as
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$

\subsubsection*{Proof}
$\varepsilon_0$ is defined as the constant of proportionality such that, $\frac{Q}{A}=\varepsilon_0E$ where charge $Q$ is evenly distributed over a surface area $A$.
\begin{align*}
    \varepsilon_0E&=\frac{Q}{A}\\
                 E&=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0A}\\
                  &=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}
\end{align*}

So the force experienced by a charge $q$ placed near $Q$ is
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{r^2}$$
