\subsection{Conservation Rules}

Particles and antiparticles obey certain conservation rules when they interact.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conservation of energy and conservation of charge} apply to all changes in science. The conservation of energy includes the rest energy of the particles.
    \item \textbf{Conservation of lepton number} - in any change, the total lepton number before the change is equal to the total lepton number for that branch after the change.
    \item \textbf{Conservation of strangeness} - in any strong interaction, strangeness is always conserved.
\end{itemize}
By assigning a \textbf{baryon number} of $+1$ to any baryon, $-1$ to any antibaryon, and 0 to any meson or lepton. We can state
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conservation of baryon number} - for any reaction, the baryon number is conserved.
\end{itemize}
Conservation rules for particle and antiparticle interactions and decays are essentially \textbf{particle-counting rules} based on reactions observed.
