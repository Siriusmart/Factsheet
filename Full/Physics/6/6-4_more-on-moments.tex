\subsection{More on Moments}

A \textbf{couple} is a pair of equal and opposite forces acting on a body, but \underline{not along the same line}.
$$\text{The moment of a couple}=\text{force}\times\text{perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces}$$

Note that the total moment is the same, regardless of the point about which the moments are taken.
