\subsection{Balanced Force}

When two forces act on a \textbf{point object}, the object is in \textbf{equilibrium} (at rest or moving at constant velocity) only if the two forces are \underline{equal and opposite} to each other.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{resultant} of the two forces is zero.
    \item The two forces are said to be \textbf{balanced}.
\end{itemize}

When \underline{three forces} act on a point object, their \textbf{resultant} is zero only if the resultant of any two of the forces is equal and opposite to the third force.
