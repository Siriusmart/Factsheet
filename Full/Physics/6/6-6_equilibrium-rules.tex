\subsection{Equilibrium Rules}

When two object interact, they always exert equal and opposite forces on one another. A \textbf{free body force diagram} shows only the forces acting on the object.

For a point object acted on by three forces to be in equilibrium.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The three forces as vectors should \textbf{form a triangle}.
    \item So their \textbf{overall resultant} is zero.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Condition for Equilibrium}

An object in equilibrium is either \textbf{at rest} or \textbf{moving with a constant velocity}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{resultant force} must be zero.
    \item The \textbf{principle of moments} must apply - the moments of the forces about the same point must balance out.
\end{itemize}
