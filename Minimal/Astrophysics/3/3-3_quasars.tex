\subsection{Quasars}

The quasar is an astronomical radio source with very strong lines.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Very large red shift corresponding to a very high speed of recession.
    \item 1000 times more luminous than the Milky Way Galaxy, variation in brightness indicates it is much smaller than a galaxy.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Quasar Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Very \textbf{powerful} light output, much greater than the light output of a star.
    \item Relative \textbf{small size} no greater than a solar system.
    \item A \textbf{large red shift} indicating distance between 5000 to 10000 million light years.
\end{itemize}

Images of quasars indicates jets of matter being ejected and galaxies nearby distorted.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Galaxy with supermassive black hole at its centre.
    \item Mass pulled in would \textbf{become very hot} due to compression as it nears the event horizon.
    \item Overheating result in clouds of hot glowing gas being thrown back into space.
\end{enumerate}

Action ceases when there are no nearby stars for the black hole to consume.
