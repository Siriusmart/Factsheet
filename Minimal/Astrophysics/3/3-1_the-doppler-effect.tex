\subsection{The Doppler Effect}

$$\text{Doppler shift}\ z=\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}=\frac{\Delta f}{f}=\frac{v}{c}$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item The line spectrum of a star or galaxy is compared with the pattern of the prominent lines in the spectrum.
    \item The change of wavelength is measured.
    \item Then \textbf{doppler shift} calculated.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spectroscopic binary} are binary systems that cannot be resolved.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each spectral line splits into two,
    \item Then merges together.
\end{enumerate}
