\subsection{Exoplanets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exoplanets} are planets outside the Solar System.
    \item The \textbf{inhabitable zone} is the zone in which liquid water may exist on a planet.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The Radial Velocity Method}

Observe the line spectrum of the light from a star to detect a \textbf{periodic Doppler shift}, because the star and the planet orbit around a \textbf{common centre of mass}.
$$v=\frac{c\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}$$

Orbital radius of a star is given by
$$v=\frac{2\pi R}{T}$$

If the \textbf{orbital plane} is inclined at angle $\theta$ to the line of sight, the orbital speed of the exoplanet is $\frac{v}{\cos\theta}$

\subsubsection*{The Transit Method}

Record the \textbf{intensity of light} from the star. If the intensity regularly dips, it is likely caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star, the exoplanet \textbf{blocks out some of the light} from the star.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The larger the exoplanet, the greater the dip.
    \item By measuring the dip in intensity, the \textbf{radius of the planet} can be estimated. The \textbf{fractional drop} of intensity at each dip is equal to the ratio of the area of the exoplanet disk to the area of the star disc.

        The radius of the planet can be estimated if the radius of the star is known.
\end{itemize}

Exoplanet transit only occurs if the line of sight to the star is in the plane of the planet's orbit.
