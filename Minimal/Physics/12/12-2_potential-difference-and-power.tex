\subsection{Potential Difference and Power}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Potential difference} is defined as the energy transferred per unit charge.

        If work $W$ is done when charge $Q$ flows through the component
        $$\text{Potential difference}\ V=\frac{W}{Q}$$
    \item The \textbf{emf} of a source of electricity is the electrical energy produced per unit charge passing through the source.

        The electrical energy produced when charge $Q$ passes through the source.
        $$W=Q\varepsilon$$
\end{itemize}


The unit for pd and emf is the \textbf{volt}, equal to 1 joule per coulomb.

\begin{align*}
    \text{Work done}\ W&=IV\Delta t\\
    \text{Electrical power}\ P&=IV
\end{align*}
