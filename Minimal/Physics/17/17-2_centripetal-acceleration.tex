\subsection{Centripetal Acceleration}

The velocity of an object moving in a circle at constant speed is \textbf{constantly changing direction}, therefore the object is \textbf{accelerating}.

The direction of the \textbf{centripetal acceleration} is always towards the centre of the circle.
$$a=\frac{v^2}{r}=\omega^2r$$
where $\omega=\dfrac{v}{r}$

The \textbf{resultant force} on an object moving around a circle at constant speed is called the \textbf{centripetal acceleration}, which acts towards the centre of the circle.

The centripetal force on an object is the \textbf{resultant force} on it.
$$\text{Centripetal force}\ F=\dfrac{mv^2}{r}=m\omega^2r$$
