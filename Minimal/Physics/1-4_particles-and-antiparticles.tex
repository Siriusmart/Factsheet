\subsection{Particles and antiparticles}

Dirac's theory of antiparticles predicted that every type of particle has a corresponding antiparticle that
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Annihilates} if they meet, converting their total mass into photons.
    \item Has the \textbf{same mass} but \textbf{opposite charge} as the particle.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Annihilation} occurs when a particle and antiparticle pair meets and their mass is converted into radiation energy - \textbf{two photons} are produced in the process.
$$\text{energy of each photon} = \text{rest mass energy of each particle}$$

A photon creates a particle and antiparticle pair in \textbf{pair production}. The minimum energy of the photon is $2E_0$ where $E_0$ is the rest mass energy of each particle.

Energy of particles are express in \textbf{MeV}, one electron volt (eV) is the energy transferred when an electron moves through a p.d. of 1 volt.
