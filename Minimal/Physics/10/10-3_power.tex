\subsection{Power}

Energy can be transferred by
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Work done} by a force due to one object making the other object move.
    \item \textbf{Heat transfer} from a hot object to a cold object.
    \item Electricity, sound waves and electromagnetic radiation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Power} is defined as the rate of transfer of energy. The unit of power is the \textbf{watt}, equal to an energy transfer rate of 1 joule per second.
$$P=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$

\subsubsection*{Engine Power}

For a powered object moves at constant velocity at constant height.
$$P=Fv$$

And
\begin{align*}
    \text{Motive power}=&\ \text{energy per second wasted due to resistive forces}\\
                        &+\text{gain of kinetic energy per second}
\end{align*}
