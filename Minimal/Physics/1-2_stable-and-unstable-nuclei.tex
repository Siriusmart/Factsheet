\subsection{Stable and unstable nuclei}

The \textbf{strong nuclei force} must exist to over come the electrostatic force of repulsion between protons. It has the same effect between any two nucleons.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attractive from 0.5fm to 3fm,
    \item Repulsive \textless0.5fm to prevent nucleons being pushed into each other.
\end{itemize}

Three types of decays
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$\alpha$.] \textbf{Alpha radiation} emits alpha particles $^4_2\alpha$.
    \item[$\beta$.] \textbf{Beta radiation} emits fast-moving electrons $\beta^-$ and an antineutrino $\bar{\nu_e}$.
    \item[$\gamma$.] \textbf{Gamma radiation} is emitted by a nucleus with too much energy, following an alpha or beta emission.
\end{enumerate}
