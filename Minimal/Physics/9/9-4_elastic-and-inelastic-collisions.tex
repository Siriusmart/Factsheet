\subsection{Elastic and Inelastic Collisions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{elastic collision} is one where there is no loss of kinetic energy.
    \item An \textbf{inelastic collision} occurs where the colliding objects have less kinetic energy after the collision than before the collision.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some of the initial kinetic energy is \textbf{transferred to the surroundings}.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
