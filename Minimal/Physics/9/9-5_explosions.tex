\subsection{Explosions}

An explosion is where two objects \textbf{fly apart} after being \textbf{initially at rest} - they recoil from each other with equal and opposite amounts of momentum.

By the principle of conservation of momentum, two objects
\begin{align*}
    m_Av_A+m_Bv_B&=0\\
    m_Av_A&=-m_Bv_B
\end{align*}
