\subsection{Conservation of Momentum}

\text{Newton's third law} states when two object interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other.

For a force to be considered a \textbf{force pair}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The two forces must be \textbf{of the same type}, and
    \item Acting on different objects.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{principle of conservation of momentum} states that for a system of interacting objects, the total momentum remains constant, provided no external resultant force acts on the system.

In a collision
$$\text{total final momentum}=\text{total initial momentum}$$
