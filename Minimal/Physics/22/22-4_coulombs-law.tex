\subsection{Coulomb's Law}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Like charges repel, unlike charges attract.
    \item The force between two charged objects depends on \textbf{how close they are} to each other.
        $F\propto\dfrac{1}{r^2}$ and $F\propto Q_1Q_2$
\end{itemize}

Coulomb law states for the force between two \textbf{point charges}.
$$F=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r^2}$$

The constant of proportionality $k=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$

Coulomb's law is written as
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
where $\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}=9.0\times10^9$m\,F$^{-1}$.
