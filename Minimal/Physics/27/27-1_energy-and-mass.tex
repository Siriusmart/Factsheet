\subsection{Energy and Mass}

The mass of an object increases when it gains energy.
$$E=mc^2$$
This relation is demonstrated in \textbf{annihilation} and \textbf{pair production}.

\subsubsection*{Energy Changes in Reactions}

Reactions on a nuclear or sub-nuclear scale involve significant changes of mass.
$$\text{Energy released}\ Q=\Delta mc^2$$

In any change where energy is released, the total mass after than change is always less than the total mass before the change, because \textbf{mass is converted to energy} which is released.
