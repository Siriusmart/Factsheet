\subsection{Energy Levels and Spectra}

Glowing gas produce a \textbf{spectrum of discrete lines} of different colours.

The wavelengths of the lines on a line spectrum are \textbf{characteristics of the atoms} of that element. We can identify the element by measuring the wavelengths of a line spectrum.
