\subsection{Applications of Simple Harmonic Motion}

The frequency of oscillation is reduced by
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding \textbf{extra mass}.
    \item Use \textbf{weaker springs}.
\end{itemize}

The acceleration is also given by
$$a=-\omega^2x\qquad\text{where $\omega^2=\dfrac{k}{m}$}$$

\subsubsection*{The Simple Pendulum}

For a simple pendulum where a mass is attached to a thread of length $L$, and angle does not exceed 10$^\circ$
$$a=-\frac{g}{L}s=-\omega^2s\qquad\text{where $\omega^2=\dfrac{g}{L}$}$$
