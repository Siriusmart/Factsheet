\subsection{The Principles of Simple Harmonic Motion}

Velocity is given by the \textbf{gradient of the displacement-time graph}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{magnitude of velocity is greatest} at zero displacement when the object passes through equilibrium.
    \item The \textbf{velocity is zero} at maximum displacement in either direction.
\end{itemize}

Acceleration is given by the \textbf{gradient of the velocity-time graph}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{acceleration is greatest} when velocity is zero at maximum displacement.
    \item The \textbf{acceleration is zero} when the velocity is a maximum displacement is zero.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Conditions for SHM}

The acceleration is
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proportional to displacement.
    \item In the opposite direction as displacement.
\end{itemize}

$$a\propto-x$$
Therefore $a=-kx$
$$a=-\omega^2x$$
