\subsection{The Particle Zoo}

\textbf{Cosmic rays} are high-energy particles from space. When they enter the Earth's atmosphere, they create new short-lived particles and antiparticles as well as photons. Including
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{muon} $\mu$ - negatively charged, 200 times the rest mass of the electron.
    \item The \textbf{pion} $\pi$ - can be charged or neutral, greater rest mass than the muon but less than proton.
    \item The \textbf{kaon} $K$ - can be charged or neutral, greater rest mass than the pion but less than proton.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Strange Particles}

Kaon are created in twos through the \textbf{strong interaction}. However, their decay through the weak interaction took longer and included \textbf{pions} as the product. Kaons are called \textbf{strange particles} due to this property.

Exotic particles can be created using \textbf{accelerators} where protons collide head-on. Their properties can then be measured.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{kaon} decay into \textbf{pions}, or $\mu+\bar\nu$, or $\bar\mu+\nu$.
    \item \textbf{Charged pions} can decay into $\mu+\bar\nu$ or $\bar\mu+\nu$.
    \item $\mathbf{\pi^0}$ meson decays into high-energy \textbf{photons}.
\end{itemize}

Decays always obey conservation rules.
