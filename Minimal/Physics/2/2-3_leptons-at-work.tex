\subsection{Leptons at Work}

Leptons and antileptons can interact to product hadrons, an \textbf{electron-positron annihilation event} can produce a quark and antiquark.

\subsubsection*{Neutrinos}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Travels near the speed of light.
    \item Billions passing through the Earth each second with almost no interaction.
    \item Produced in \textbf{beta and muon decays}.
\end{itemize}

Neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in beta decays are different from that in muon decays. $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$ are two types of neutrinos.

\subsubsection*{Lepton Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Change into other leptons through the \textbf{weak interaction}.
    \item Produced or annihilated in \textbf{particle-antiparticle interactions}.
    \item They appear to be \textbf{fundamental} - don't break down into non-leptons.
\end{itemize}

Interaction between \textbf{a lepton (neutrino or antineutrino) and a hadron} changes it into or from a corresponding charged lepton.

The \textbf{lepton number} is $+1$ for any lepton, $-1$ for antilepton, $0$ for non-lepton. Lepton number is conserved.
$$\nu_e+n\to p+e^-$$

In \textbf{muon decay}, the muon changes into a muon neutrino.
$$\mu^-\to e^-+\bar{\nu_e}+\nu_\mu$$
