\subsection{Conservation Rules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy and charge} are conserved in all changes in science.
    \item \textbf{Lepton number} is conserved in any change.
    \item \textbf{Strangeness} is conserved in any strong interaction.
    \item \textbf{Baryon number} is conserved in any change.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{baryon number} is $+1$ for any baryon, $-1$ for antibaryon, 0 for mesons and leptons.
