\subsection{Particle Sorting}

Particles can be divided into two groups according to whether they interact through the \textbf{strong interaction}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hadrons} can interact through \underline{all four fundamental interactions}, including the \textbf{strong interaction}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The proton is the only stable hadron.
            \item Hadrons tend to decay through the weak interaction.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Leptons} interact only through the \textbf{weak}, gravitational and electromagnetic interaction.
\end{itemize}

The hadrons can be divided into two groups
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baryons} are protons and all other hadrons that \underline{decay into protons}.
    \item \textbf{Mesons} are hadrons that do not include protons in their decay products.
\end{itemize}

Baryons and mesons are composed of smaller \textbf{quarks} and \textbf{antiquarks}.
