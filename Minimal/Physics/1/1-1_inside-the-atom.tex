\subsection{Inside the atom}

\textbf{Rutherford's alpha-scattering investigations} shows every atom contains
\begin{itemize}
    \item Positively charged \textbf{nucleus} composed of \textbf{nucleons}, and
    \item \textbf{Electrons} surrounding the nucleus.
\end{itemize}
where mass is concentrated in the nucleus, the electrostatic force of attraction between the electrons and the nucleus traps them in the atom.

The atom consists of mostly empty space. An uncharged atom as equal number of protons and electrons, it becomes an ion if it gains or loses electrons.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & Charge/C & Relative charge & Mass/kg & Relative mass\\
    \hline
    proton & $+1.6\times10^{-19}$ & 1 & $1.6\times10^{-27}$ & 1\\
    neutron & $0$ & 1 & $1.6\times10^{-27}$ & 1\\
    electron & $-1.6\times10^{-19}$ & 1 & $9.1\times10^{-31}$ & 0.0005\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{atomic number} $Z$ is the proton number.
    \item The \textbf{mass number} $A$ is the nucleon number.
\end{itemize}

Every atom of a given element has the same atom number. \textbf{Isotopes} are atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons.

The \textbf{isotope notation} can be used to label isotopes.
$$^A_ZX$$

The \textbf{specific charge} of a charge particle is defined as $\frac{\text{charge}}{\text{mass}}$.
