\subsection{Photons}

Light is a small part of the \textbf{electromagnetic spectrum}. \textbf{Electromagnetic waves} consists of an electric and magnetic wave vibrating in phase and right angle to each other.

Light travels at $c=3.0\times10^8\text{ms}^{-1}$ in vacuum. Its frequency and wavelength are related by
$$f\lambda=c$$

Electromagnetic waves are emitted when a charged particle loses energy, including
\begin{itemize}
    \item A fast moving electron is stopped.
    \item An \textbf{atomic electron} moves to a lower shell.
\end{itemize}

EM waves are emitted in wave packets known as \textbf{photons}. The photon theory is used to explain the \textbf{photoelectric effect}.
$$\text{photon energy}\ E=hf$$
where $h=6.63\times10^{-34}\text{Js}$ is \textbf{Planck's constant}.
