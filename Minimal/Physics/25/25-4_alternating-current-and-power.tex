\subsection{Alternating Current and Power}

The alternating current is a current that \textbf{repeatedly reverses its direction}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mains electricity has a frequency of 50Hz.
    \item Peak current depends on peak pd of the alternating current source.
    \item Peak pd of mains is 325V.
\end{itemize}

The power supplied to the heater is given by $P=I^2R$
\begin{itemize}
    \item At \textbf{peak current} $I_0$, maximum power supplied is equal to $I_0^2R$.
    \item At zero current, zero power is supplied.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{root mean square} value of an alternating current is the value of direct current that would give the same heating effect as the alternating current in the same resistor.
\begin{align*}
    I_\text{rms}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}I_0\\
    V_\text{rms}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}V_0
\end{align*}

The mean power is therefore $\frac{1}{2}I_0^2R$
