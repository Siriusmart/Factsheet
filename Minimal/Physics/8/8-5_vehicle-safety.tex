\subsection{Vehicle Safety}

The effect of a collision on a vehicle can be measured in terms of the \textbf{acceleration} of the vehicle - expressed in terms of $g$.

The \textbf{impact time} $t$ is the duration of the impact force.
\begin{align*}
    \text{impact time}\ t&=\frac{2s}{u+v}\\
    \text{acceleration}\ a&=\frac{v-u}{t}\\
    \text{impact force}\ F&=ma
\end{align*}
