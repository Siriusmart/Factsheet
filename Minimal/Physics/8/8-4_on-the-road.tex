\subsection{On the Road}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thinking distance} is the distance travelled by a vehicle in the time it takes the driver to react.
        $$s_1=ut_0$$
    \item \textbf{Braking distance} is the distance travelled by a car in the time it takes to stop safely.
        $$s_2=\frac{u^2}{2a}$$
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{stopping distance}&=\text{thinking distance}+\text{braking distance}\\
                              &=ut_0+\frac{u^2}{2a}
\end{align*}
