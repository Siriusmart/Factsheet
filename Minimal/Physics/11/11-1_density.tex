\subsection{Density}

The density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.
$$\rho=\frac{m}{V}$$

\subsubsection*{Measuring Density}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular solids} - measure its mass using a \textbf{top pan balance}, then measure its dimensions using a \textbf{vernier caliper} and calculate its volume.
    \item \textbf{Liquid} - measure the mass of an empty \textbf{measuring cylinder} and measure the volume of the liquid. Measure the mass of a cylinder with liquid and calculate the mass of the liquid.
    \item \textbf{Irregular solid} - measure the mass of the object, and \textbf{immerse the object} in a liquid. The increase in liquid level is the volume of the object.
\end{itemize}
