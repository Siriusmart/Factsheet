\subsection{Acceleration}

\textbf{Acceleration} is defined as change of velocity per unit time.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The unit of acceleration is the metre per second per second $$\text{ms}^{-2}$$.
    \item \textbf{Deceleration} values are negative and signify that velocity \textbf{decreases with respect to time}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Uniform acceleration} is where the velocity of an object moving along a straight line changes at a \underline{constant rate} - the acceleration is constant.

\textbf{Non-uniform acceleration} is where the direction of motion of an object changes, or its speed changes.

$$\text{Acceleration}=\text{gradient of the line on the velocity-time graph}$$
