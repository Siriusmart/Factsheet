\subsection{Free Fall}

Investigate the free fall of a ball
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a \textbf{video clip} of the ball's flight as it falls after being released from rest.
    \item For each frame of the ball in the video, the \textbf{time of descent} of the ball and the \textbf{distance fallen} by the ball can be measured.
    \item Use the equation $s=ut+\dfrac{1}{2}at^2$, plot a graph of $s$ against $t^2$. Then the acceleration is $2\times\text{gradient}$.
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{acceleration of free fall} is the value of acceleration when there are \underline{no external forces} acting on the object apart from the force of gravity, and is represented by the symbol $g$.
$$g\approx9.8\text{ms}^{-2}$$
