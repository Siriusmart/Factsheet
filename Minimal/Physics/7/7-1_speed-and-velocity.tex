\subsection{Speed and Velocity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Displacement} is distance in a given direction.
    \item \textbf{Speed} is defined as change of distance per unit time.
    \item \textbf{Velocity} is defined as change of displacement per unit time - velocity is speed in a given direction.
\end{itemize}

The unit of speed and velocity is the metre per second $\text{ms}^{-1}$.

\subsubsection*{Distance-time Graph}

A \textbf{distance-time graph} is a graph of distance against time.

For motion at constant speed, its distance-time graph is a straight line with a constant gradient.
$$\text{speed}\ v=\frac{s}{t}=\text{gradient of line}$$

For motion at changing speed that travels a distance $s$ in time $t$
$$\text{average speed}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$
The gradient of the line at any point can be found by drawing a \textbf{tangent to the line} and then measuring the gradient of the tangent.

The delta $\Delta$ notation means \textbf{a change of something}.

An object moving at \textbf{constant velocity} moves at the same speed without changing its direction of motion.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If an object changes its direction of motion or its speed or both, its velocity changes.
\end{itemize}
