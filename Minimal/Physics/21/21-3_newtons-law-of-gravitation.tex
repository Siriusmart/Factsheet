\subsection{Newton's Law of Gravitation}

\textbf{Kepler's third law} states that the value of $\dfrac{r^3}{T^2}$ is the same for all planets.

\textbf{Newton's law of gravitation} states that the gravitational force between any two \textbf{point objects} is
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always an \textbf{attractive} force.
    \item Proportional to the mass of each object.
    \item Proportional to $\dfrac{1}{r^2}$.
\end{itemize}
$$F_g=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$

$G$ is the \textbf{universal constant of gravitation}.
$$G=6.67\times10^{-11}\text{N\,m$^2$\,kg$^{-2}$}$$
