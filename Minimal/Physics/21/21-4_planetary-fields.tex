\subsection{Planetary Fields}

The field for a spherical mass is the same as if the mass were concentrated at its centre.

For a \textbf{point mass} (or spherical mass) $M$
$$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}=\frac{g_sR^2}{r^2}$$
where $g_s$ is $g$ at the surface with radius $R$.

Inside the planet, $g\propto r$.

\subsubsection*{Gravitational Potential}
At or beyond the surface of a spherical planet.
$$V=-\frac{GM}{r}$$

The \textbf{escape velocity} from a planet is the minimum velocity an object must be given to escape from the planet.
$$v_\text{esc}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}=\sqrt{2gR}$$
