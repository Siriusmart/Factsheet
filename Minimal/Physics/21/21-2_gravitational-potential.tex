\subsection{Gravitational Potential}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gravitational potential energy} is the energy of an object due to its position in a gravitational field, the position for zero GPE is at infinity.
    \item The \textbf{gravitational potential} at a point is the \textbf{work done per unit mass} to move a small object from infinity to that point.
\end{itemize}
$$V=\frac{W}{m}$$
The unit of gravitational potential is J\,kg$^{-1}$.
$$\Delta E_p=m\Delta V$$

\subsubsection*{Potential Gradients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Equipotentials} are surfaces of constant potential.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No work is done when moving along an equipotential surface.
            \item In a small region, the equipotentials are \textbf{parallel to the ground}, as the gravitational field over a small region is uniform.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{potential gradient} at a point in a gravitational field is the \textbf{change in potential per metre} at that point.
\end{itemize}

Gravitational field strength is the negative of the potential gradient.
$$g=-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}$$
The minus sign shows $g$ acts in the opposite direction to the potential gradient.
