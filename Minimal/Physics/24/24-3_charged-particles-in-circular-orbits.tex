\subsection{Charged Particles in Circular Orbits}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The force of the magnetic field on a moving charge is at \textbf{right angles to the direction of the motion} of the particle.
    \item \textbf{No work is done} by the magnetic field on the particle as the force always acts at right angles to the velocity of the particle. The particle's direction change but not its speed - the kinetic energy of the particle is unchanged by the magnetic field.
    \item The particle therefore moves on a \textbf{circular path} with the force always acting towards the centre of curvature of the circular path. The force causes \textbf{centripetal acceleration} because it is perpendicular to the velocity.
    \item The path is a \textbf{complete circle} because the magnetic field is uniform and the particle remains in the field.
\end{itemize}
