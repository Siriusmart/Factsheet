\subsection{Particle interactions}

\textbf{Momentum} is transferred between objects through equal and opposite forces when two objects interact.

\subsubsection*{Electromagnetic force}
between charged objects is due to the exchange of \textbf{virtual photons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cannot be detected directly.
    \item Stops the force acting if intercepted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Weak nuclear force}
causes the $\beta^-$ and $\beta^+$ decay.

These interactions are due to the exchange of \textbf{W bosons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have a non-zero rest mass.
    \item Very short range around 0.001fm.
    \item Can be charged $W^+$ and $W^-$.
\end{itemize}

The W boson meets a neutrino or antineutrino, changing them into a $\beta^-$ or $\beta^+$ particle respectively.

A proton in a proton-rich nucleus turns into a neutrons through \textbf{electron capture}, it weakly interacts with an inner-shell electron outside the nucleus.

The photon and W boson are known as \textbf{force carriers} because they are exchanged when the electromagnetic or weak force act.
