\subsection{Stationary and Progressive Waves}

Stationary waves are formed when two progressive waves pass through each other.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a \textbf{string in tension} by fixing both ends.
    \item Make the middle part vibrate - progressive waves travel towards each end, reflect at the ends, and pass through each other.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{fundamental mode of vibration} consists of a single loop.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes} at either end - point of no displacement.
    \item \textbf{Antinodes} between the nodes - point of maximum amplitude.
\end{itemize}
$$\text{Distance between adjacent nodes}=\frac{1}{2}\lambda$$

If the frequency is raised, the pattern disappears and a new pattern is observed with \textbf{two equal loops} along the rope.

\textbf{Stationary waves that vibrate freely do not transfer energy to their surroundings.}

The phase difference between two vibrating particles is
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 if to particles are separated by an \textbf{even number of nodes}.
    \item $\pi$ rad if separated by an \textbf{odd number of nodes}.
\end{itemize}
