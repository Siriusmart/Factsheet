\subsection{Wave Properties 1}

A \textbf{ripple tank} can be used to study wave properties.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wavefronts} are lines of constant phase.
    \item The direction in which a wave travels is at right angles to the wavefront.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
When a light ray is directed at a \textbf{plane mirror}, the angle between the incident ray and the mirror is equal to the angle between the reflected ray and the mirror.

\subsubsection*{Refraction}

When waves pass across a boundary at which the \textbf{wave speed changes}, the \textbf{wavelength also changes}. If the wavefronts approach at an angle to the boundary, they change direction as well as changing speed.

Refraction of light is observed when a light ray is directed into a glass block at an angle.

\subsubsection*{Diffraction}
Diffraction occurs when \textbf{waves spread out after passing through a gap}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The narrower the gap, the more the waves spread out.
    \item The longer the wavelength, the more the waves spread out.
\end{itemize}
