\subsection{Circuit Rules}

\subsubsection*{Current Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kirchoff's first law}: At any junction in a circuit, the total current leaving the junction is equal to the total current entering the junction.
    \item For \textbf{components in series}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The current entering a component is the same as the current leaving the component.
            \item The current passing through two or more components in series is the \textbf{same through each component}.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Potential Difference Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the charge carriers lose energy, the potential difference is a \textbf{potential drop}.
    \item If the charge carriers gains energy, the potential difference is a \textbf{potential rise} equal to the pd across the battery of the cell's terminal.
    \item For two or more \textbf{components in series}, the total pd across all the components is equal to the sum of the potential differences across each component.
    \item The pd across components in parallel is the same.
    \item \textbf{Kirchoff's second law}: For any complete loop of a circuit, the sum of the emfs around the loop is equal to the sum of the potential drops around the loop.
\end{itemize}
