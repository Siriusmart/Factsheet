\subsection{The Potential Divider}

A \textbf{potential divider} consists of
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two or more \textbf{resistors in series} which each other.
    \item A source of \textbf{fixed potential difference}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Supply a Fixed PD}

The \textbf{ratio of the pds} across each resistor is equal to the \textbf{resistance ratio} of the two resistors.
$$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}$$
and
$$V_2=\frac{V_0R_2}{R_1+R_2}$$

\subsubsection*{Supply a Variable PD}

The source pd connected to a \textbf{fixed length of uniform resistance wire} where a \textbf{sliding contact} on the wire can be moved along the wire. Giving a variable pd between the contact and the end of the wire.

\subsubsection*{Sensor Circuits}

A sensor circuit produces an output pd which \textbf{changes as a result of a change of a physical variable}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{temperature sensor} consists of a potential divider made using a \textbf{thermistor} and a \textbf{variable resistor}.
    \item A \textbf{light sensor} uses a \textbf{light-dependent resistor} and a \textbf{variable resistor}.
\end{itemize}
