\subsection{More about Resistance}

For \textbf{resistors in series}, the total resistance is equal to the \textbf{sum of the individual resistances}.
$$R=R_1+R_2+R_3+\cdots$$

For \textbf{resistors in parallel}, the resistance total resistance is given by
$$\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+\cdots$$

\subsubsection*{Resistance Heating}

The heating effect of an electric current in any component is due to the \textbf{resistance of the component}.
$$P=IV=I^2R$$
