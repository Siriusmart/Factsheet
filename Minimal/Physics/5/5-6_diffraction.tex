\subsection{Diffraction}

Diffraction is the \textbf{spreading out of waves} when they pass through a gap or by an edge.

\textbf{Diffraction of water waves} through a gap shows that diffracted waves spread out more if
\begin{itemize}
    \item The gap is made narrower, or
    \item The wavelength is made larger.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diffraction of light by a single slit} can be demonstrated by directing a \textbf{parallel beam of light} at the slit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The pattern show a \textbf{central fringe} \underline{twice as wide} as the outer fringes.
    \item Each \textbf{outer fringe} is the \underline{same width}.
    \item \textbf{Peak intensity} of each fringe \underline{decreases with distance} from the centre.
\end{itemize}
$$\text{Width of the central fringe}\ w=\frac{2\lambda D}{a}$$
where $a$ is the width of the single slit.
