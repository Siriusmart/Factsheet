\subsection{Capacitance}

A \textbf{capacitor} is a device designed to store charge, two parallel metal plates placed near each other form a capacitor.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A capacitors consists of two \textbf{conductors insulated from each other}.
    \item When connected to a battery, one plate gains an equal number of electrons lost by the other plate.
    \item When the charge stored in the capacitor is $Q$, one conductor store charge $+Q$ and the other $-Q$.
\end{itemize}

The capacitance of a capacitor is defined as \textbf{charge stored per unit pd}.
$$C=\frac{Q}{V}$$
The unit of capacitance is the \textbf{farad}, equal to one coulomb per volt.
