\subsubsection{Energy Stored in a Charged Capacitor}

When a capacitor is charged, \textbf{energy is stored in it} because electrons are forced onto one of its plates and taken off the other plate.
$$\text{Energy stored by a capacitor}\ E=\frac{1}{2}QV$$

Other forms of the equation are $E=\dfrac{1}{2}CV^2$ and $E=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{Q^2}{V}$.
