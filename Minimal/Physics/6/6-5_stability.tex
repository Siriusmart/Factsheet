\subsection{Stability}

If a body in \textbf{stable equilibrium} is displaced then released, it returns to its equilibrium position.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{centre of mass} of the object is directly below the point of support when the object is at rest.
    \item The \textbf{weight} of the object is considered to act at its centre of mass.
    \item So the \textbf{support force} and the weight are directly equal and opposite to each other when the object is at equilibrium.
    \item When it is displaced, the line of action of the weight no longer pass through the point of support.
    \item So the weight returns the object to equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

If an object in \textbf{unstable equilibrium} is displaced slightly from equilibrium then released, the object experiences a force in the direction of displacement.
