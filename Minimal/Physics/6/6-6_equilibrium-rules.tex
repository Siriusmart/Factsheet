\subsection{Equilibrium Rules}

When two objects interact, they exert \textbf{equal and opposite forces} on one another. A \textbf{free body force diagram} shows only the forces acting on the object.

For a body to be in \textbf{equilibrium}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{resultant force must be zero}.
    \item The \textbf{principle of momentum must apply}.
\end{itemize}
