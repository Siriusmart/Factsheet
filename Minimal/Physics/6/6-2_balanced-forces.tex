\subsection{Balanced Forces}

An object in \textbf{equilibrium} stays at rest or moves at a constant velocity.

\begin{itemize}
    \item When two forces act on a \textbf{point object}, the object is in \textbf{equilibrium} only if the two forces are equal and opposite to each other.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{resultant} of the two force is zero.
            \item The two forces are said to be \textbf{balanced}.
        \end{itemize}
    \item When three forces act on a \textbf{point object}, the \textbf{resultant} is zero only if the resultant of any two forces is \textbf{equal and opposite to the third force}.
\end{itemize}
