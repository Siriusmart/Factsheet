\subsection{Assembly Language}

Assembly languages uses mnemonics to represent \textbf{operation code and addresses}. The \textbf{assembler} translates an assembly language program into machine code for execution.

A \textbf{logical shift right} causes the least significant bit to be shifted into the \textbf{carry bit}, and a zero moves in to occupy the vacated space.
