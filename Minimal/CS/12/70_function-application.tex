\subsection{Functional Application}

A \textbf{higher-order function} is one which either takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

\textbf{Partial application} means binding the values of some inputs to a function to produce another \textbf{more specific function}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Map} is a higher-order function that takes a list and the function to be applied to the elements in the list as inputs, and returns a list by applying the function to each element in the old list.
    \item \textbf{Filter} is a higher-order function which takes a \textbf{predicate} and a list, this returns the elements within the list that satisfy the boolean condition.
    \item \textbf{Fold} reduces a list into a \textbf{single value} using recursion.
\end{itemize}
